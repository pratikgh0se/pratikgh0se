# 👋 Hey there, I'm Pratik Ghose!

I'm a **Software Development Engineer** with a passion for building scalable, secure, and observable systems that make a real impact. With over 5 years of experience, I’ve led migrations saving **$720K annually**, slashed metrics by **33%**, and automated workflows to cut deployment times by **25%**. I thrive at the intersection of code, collaboration, and curiosity—whether it’s debugging a tricky CI/CD pipeline or mentoring a teammate to their first PR.

🔭 **Currently Exploring**: Cloud-native observability, Kubernetes orchestration, and automated root cause analysis tools.  
🌍 **Based In**: Hyderabad, India, but open to opportunities in **Europe** (Amsterdam, Switzerland, London) and **Southeast Asia** (Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand).  
💡 **Fun Fact**: I once turned a chaotic hotfix process into a Slack-powered automation flow—because who has time for manual approvals?

## 🛠️ What I Bring to the Table

- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (EKS, Secrets Manager), GCP, Azure, Terraform, ArgoCD, Docker, Kubernetes.  
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, OpenTelemetry—because visibility is power.  
- **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, AWS Lambda, and GitHub Actions to ship faster and smarter.  
- **Programming**: Python, Go, Java for robust APIs and tools.  
- **Beyond Code**: Leading migrations, mentoring juniors, and crafting docs that actually get read.

I’m all about solving tough problems with clean solutions—think streamlining **16TB of daily data to 4TB** or building a custom RCA tool to cut incident resolution by **20%**. I also love sharing knowledge, whether it’s through a detailed migration guide or a quick Slack tip.

## 🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

- **Observability Overhaul**  
  - Migrated legacy tools (Prometheus, Thanos, Elasticsearch) to a unified New Relic platform.  
  - Reduced storage costs by **96TB/month** and boosted GDPR compliance with secure secret rotations.  
  - *Check out my repos for sample configs!*  

- **EKS Migration**  
  - Led a shift to Amazon EKS, enhancing scalability and saving **$720K/year**.  
  - Automated cluster backups and alerts with Terraform—zero downtime, all smiles.  

- **Pharos: Automated RCA**  
  - Built a tool to analyze metrics, logs, and Jira tickets, slashing MTTR by **20%**.  
  - Powered by a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation system—because manual debugging is so 2020.

- **Hotfix Automation**  
  - Turned a clunky process into a Slack + email workflow, automating **80% of steps**.  
  - PR merges, builds, and deployments now happen faster than my coffee order.

## 🌟 What Drives Me

I’m hooked on the thrill of untangling complex systems—whether it’s optimizing a Terraform script, weaving a linked list into a zigzag pattern, or figuring out why `curl` won’t resolve a domain (spoiler: DNS is *always* the culprit). I ask “why” a lot, from debugging 404s in GitHub Actions to exploring Go vs. Rust for my next project. Outside of code, you’ll find me mentoring new devs, sketching flowcharts for observability pipelines, or sipping chai while pondering the next big automation.
